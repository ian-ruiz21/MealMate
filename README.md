## Description

**MealMate** is a web application that allows users to share and discover recipes with a community of food lovers. Users can create profiles, upload their favorite recipes, and explore new dishes shared by others, while connecting with fellow food enthusiasts.

### Background Information

The idea for this app stemmed from my passion for cooking and the desire to create a platform where people can share recipes and find culinary inspiration. **MealMate** aims to foster a community of home cooks, chefs, and foodies who want to share their love for food and explore new dishes.
